            <p>Scheduling was a breeze and the service was impeccable. I was a little surprised at the first cost of removing weeds, but it was something that needed immediate attention due to the lack of care during the spring and summer on my part due to an on-going injury. Professional, prompt and neat - my yard looks amazing. I will use them again. -Nicole H</p>
            <p>They are really good. They were clean, prompt, on time, and friendly. I would use them again in the future. -Chantal H</p>
            <p>They've been servicing our garden for a few years now and we have been pleased with their professionalism and quality of work. They have also made nice suggestions that made our place look great! I would recommend Enchanted gardeners. -Rich Mason</p>
            <p>Enchanted Gardener is....what can I say...enchanting! They take wonderful ideas and make them happen! They take the time to help you understand how to care for your planters and keep them beautiful. Can't wait for their fall ideas. -Suzy Cox

            <p>Such beautiful work and friendly gardeners! Enchanted Gardener took my patio planters from blah to WOW!!! -Martha Munch</p>
            <p>We could not be happier with the landscape job these guys & gals did!! Dave, Portia & the entire team have been wonderful to work with. During the design process Portia really delivered a better than expected, low maintenance but not generic landscape layout. Iâ€™m so in love with a yard I once despised! ðŸ’œ -Kelly Dugan</p>
            <p>Friendly service and the mulch/landscaping turned out great. Thanks! -Ben Massie</p>
